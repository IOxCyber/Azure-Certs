1. Azure Virtual Desktop: Another type of virtual machine is the Azure Virtual Desktop. Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud.

2. Containers: a virtualization environment. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, you can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host.

3. Azure Functions/Serverless computing - An event-driven code(if needed for scaling up/down, updating, managing resources, it can happen without user involvement).
Doesn’t require maintaining virtual machines or containers (Infra).
4. Serverless (User can deploy the code without concerning of Infra maintaining, scalability the servers.)

5. Geo > Regions 60+ in 140 Countries (group of datacenters) > Zones(physical separated Datacenter within Regions) > 1st Need a Subscription > resource Groups > A resource needs to be created.

### Regions are paired by another regions.
> Zones, connected with fiber-optics, Each datacenter is independent power, cooling & networking.


### Availability Options: Hight SLA is less failure protected.
- VM SLA (99.9% with Premium Storage, Single VM, Easier lift & Shift).
- VM SLA (99.99% with Availability zones, protected from Datacenter failures)
- Multi-Region (Region Pairs SLA (99.999% , protected by Data residency boundaries)  

### App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure.

### With App Service, you can host most common app service styles like:
- Web apps
- API apps
- Web Jobs
- Mobile apps

- Web Jobs feature to run a program (.exe, Java, PHP, Python, or Node.js) or script (cmd, .bat, PowerShell, or Bash) in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app.

- Azure Resources: Components availed on Cloud
> VM, Storage Accounts, Virtual n/w, App Services, SQL DB, Functions.  

- Resource Groups:
A container to manage resources in a single units. (Used to apply policies, Can be in differ regions, movable to differ group)
App can utilize multiple resource groups.

- ARM (Azure Resource Manager) Template: to create, update, delete resources (JSON Template):
The instructions given by Azure portal, Azure powerShell, Azure CLI, REST clients(Java, Python etc) to manage the resources.

- Azure Subscription:
Sub can be divided into sub Subscription.

- A sandbox gives you access to Azure resources, Provide CLI to execute the commands.
Eg. az version, az interactive

> Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com/#home

- The physical infrastructure for Azure starts with datacenters. Conceptually, the datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters. They’re facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. https://infrastructuremap.microsoft.com/

- A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.

- Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

- Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure. You may need to use a sovereign region for compliance or legal purposes.


### Management:
- Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
- Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
- Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
- Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

 ### Manage Azure through a web portal.
- Using a command line interface.
- Using APIs.
- Using PowerShell.

### Shared responsibility model:
- The shared responsibility model applies to all the cloud service types
