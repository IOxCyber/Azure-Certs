1. VPC:
-  Enables users to provision and manage their own logically isolated network.
-  Provides a way to organize and control cloud resources (VM, Storage, networking components etc)
-  offer network isolation, allowing users to create multiple VPCs for different projects, teams, or applications.

2. VPC Peering:
- you can ping/communicate via internal IPs by peering 2 different VPC.
- Once peered, instances within these VPCs can communicate with each other using internal IP addresses, as if they were on the same network.
- Communication over internal IPs is cheaper than Public IP.
