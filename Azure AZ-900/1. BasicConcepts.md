# Microsoft Azure:
a cloud computing platform that provides on-demand computing services related to IT infrastructure 
such as compute (Processors & Memories, eg. CPU, RAM, Storage(Backup) eg. to execute App), databases, 
and networking(To communicate b/t distributed apps), Analytics (Peak hours, Where is Error, resources needed), 
virtual machines, web services, AI & IoT related services.

- Shared Responsibilities:
Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider.

The consumer is responsible for the data and information stored & access security in the cloud.
With an on-premises datacenter, youâ€™re responsible for everything  (A group of servers that you privately own and control).

> Responsibility on Consumer => (Least) SaaS < PaaS < IaaS (Most)

Always Responsibility of Consumer: Info & data stored, Allowed Devices, Account & identities.
Always Responsibility of Cloud Provider: Physical Datacenter, network, hosts.
Determine Responsibility for Things: OS, Network Controls, App, Identity & Infra.

> Azure Cloud Ideology: *Pay-as-you-go* Only pay for what you use.

## Cloud Model:

1. Private: built, controlled, and maintained by a single entity (More privacy, Costly, For highly sensitive data) 
2. Public: built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider.
3. Hybrid: Combination of both Private & Public
4. Multi-Cloud: Here you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

- Azure Arc: set of technologies that helps manage your any kind of cloud environment.
- Azure VMware Solution: Helps in migrating to Cloud.

- Consumption Based Models:
1. Capital Expense (CapEx) is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. 
A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.

2. Operation Expense (OpEx) is spending money on services or products over time. 
Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

> Cloud computing falls under OpEx. Cloud is a consumption-based model, you only pay for what you use.

- Cloud Benefits:
High availability: 99.1 < 99.5 < 99.99 (Expensive)
Scalability: Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
     1. Vertical: Increasing the Capacity of a resources Eg. Vertical scaling (Add/Remove CPU & RAM)
     2. Horizontal: Increasing the Number of resources. Eg. Horizontal scaling (Add/Remove VMs) 
Global Reach: Availability of Servers in different regions.

###

- Agility: ability of an organization to quickly adapt to market changes, to respond rapidly and flexibly to customer demand.
- Elasticity(Sudden Up/Down): The ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them.
- Predictive Cost: You can predict the cost of Infra using.
- Disaster Recovery: Availability of Services in case of disaster.
- Security: Digital & Physical Security

> Elasticity is used just to meet the sudden up and down in the workload for a small period of time. 
> Scalability is used to meet the static increase in the workload.

- Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service. These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).
- Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.

- Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability.
- Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers.
- Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend.
