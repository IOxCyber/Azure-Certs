1. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD): A cloud-based identity and access management service provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows organizations to manage user identities and access to resources, enabling single sign-on (SSO) to thousands of cloud applications and providing advanced security features such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Conditional Access, and Identity Protection.

2. Azure Information Protection (AIP): A cloud-based service that helps organizations classify and protect sensitive information. With AIP, organizations can label and classify documents and emails based on their sensitivity, apply encryption and rights management policies to protect data both inside and outside the organization, and track and monitor data usage and access.

3. Understand Azure Security Center: A unified security management solution that provides threat protection across hybrid cloud workloads. Azure Security Center continuously monitors the security posture of Azure resources and provides security recommendations, threat detection, and security alerts to help organizations protect against threats and vulnerabilities.

4. Azure Security Center Standard tier: An advanced security management solution that provides advanced threat protection, security alerts, and security recommendations. In addition to the features available in the free tier, the Standard tier includes advanced threat detection capabilities such as behavioral analytics, threat intelligence integration, and automation of security controls through Security Playbooks.

5. Learn Azure Sentinel: A cloud-based SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) service that provides intelligent security analytics. Azure Sentinel collects and analyzes security data from across the organization, including logs, events, and alerts, using advanced AI and machine learning capabilities to detect and respond to threats in real-time.

6. Azure Virtual Network (VNet): A logically isolated network in the Azure cloud that enables secure communication between Azure resources. VNets can be used to segment and isolate workloads, define network security policies using Network Security Groups (NSGs), and connect on-premises networks to Azure securely using VPN or ExpressRoute.

7. Conditional Access: A feature in Azure AD that enables administrators to set policies that control access to applications and resources based on various conditions. With Conditional Access, organizations can enforce access controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), device compliance checks, location-based access policies, and session controls to protect against unauthorized access.

8. Key Vault: A service based in the cloud that allows customers to protect and oversee cryptographic keys and confidential information. Key Vault can be used to store and manage secrets such as digital certificates, API keys, database connection strings, and encryption keys, and provides features such as key rotation, access control, and auditing for secure key management.

9. Network Security Group (NSG): A security group that controls traffic flow to and from Azure resources. NSGs allow organizations to define inbound and outbound security rules to restrict or allow traffic based on IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols, providing a basic level of network security for Azure resources.

10. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): A security management strategy that merges security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) to offer immediate analysis of security alerts generated by network equipment and applications in real-time. SIEM solutions such as Azure Sentinel aggregate and correlate security data from various sources to detect and respond to security threats effectively.

11. Secure Score: A feature in Azure Security Center that provides a score based on an organizationâ€™s security posture and provides recommendations to improve security. Secure Score helps organizations assess their security posture, identify gaps and vulnerabilities, and take proactive steps to enhance their overall security posture by implementing recommended security controls and best practices.

12. Threat Intelligence: Information about potential or actual security threats, such as indicators of compromise (IOCs) and malicious URLs, that can be used to improve security defenses. Threat intelligence feeds provide organizations with real-time data on emerging threats, enabling them to identify and respond to security incidents more effectively and proactively protect against cyber threats.

13. Virtual Private Network (VPN): A secure connection between two networks that allows remote access to a private network, such as an Azure Virtual Network. VPNs encrypt traffic between the client and the server, providing a secure and private communication channel over the public internet, and enabling users to access resources on the Azure network securely from remote locations.
