5. The purpose of a dedicated `Hardware Security Module (HSM) is to securely manage and store cryptographic keys, perform cryptographic operations, and enforce security policies` to protect sensitive data and applications from unauthorized access and tampering.

## Quiz:
- Key Vault is specifically designed for securely storing and accessing secrets, keys, and certificates, providing a centralized management solution for these sensitive data.
- Azure Policy is used to enforce organizational standards and assess compliance at scale, ensuring resources conform to corporate policies and regulatory requirements.
- Azure Blueprints automate the deployment of resources, including security policies, RBAC settings, and ARM templates, ensuring a consistent and compliant environment.
- Azure Key Vault supports configuring automatic key rotation policies, enhancing security by regularly updating cryptographic keys without manual intervention.
- Dedicated HSMs provide a high level of security for cryptographic operations and key management by physically isolating and protecting keys from unauthorized access.
