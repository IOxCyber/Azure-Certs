# Secure Azure solutions with Azure Active Directory:

## Active Directory:
- `Cloud-based identity and access management service to secure Azure services & resources.`
- ![Alt text](image.png)
- Used by IT Admins, Devs, and CRM for SSO, Credentials, Secure Key, self-service password reset, and MFA, domain controller[^1].
- Paid licenses (Premium P1 and P2) enhance Azure AD with self-service options, advanced administration, and security features.

## Types of AD:
1. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD): Cloud-based identity and mobile device management
2. Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS): Enterprise-ready lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP)[^2] server that provides key features such as identity and authentication, computer object management, group policy, and trusts.
3. Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS): Combination of Azure AD + Domain Services.

[^1]: to manage trust among the domains by granting access to users from one domain to the other via a proper security authentication process.
[^2]: think of a directory as a database that stores information about users, groups, and resources within an organization. LDAP provides a way to search, retrieve, and modify this information in a structured manner.
[^3]: Both Kerberos and NTLM provide a way to verify the identity of users and grant access to resources based on their credentials. However, Kerberos is considered more secure and efficient, and it is the preferred authentication mechanism in modern IT environments.
