# Core Services in Cloud

1. Azure IoT: ability of devices to gather data & relay for Data analysis. (Internet, IP required for Devices)
2. Azure IoT hub: Central Msg hub, bi dir communication b/w IoT app & devices. (PaaS)
3. Azure IT Central: SaaS solution to manage, monitor, connect to IoT devices at scale.
4. Big Data & Analytics: HDS

5. Azure HDInsight: Fully managed, Open source analytics service for enterprises.
6. Azure Databricks: Apache Spark based commercial analytics services.(MS collaboration with Databricks) (Used by Data analyst, Data scientist for ML)
7. Azure Synapse Analytics: cloud-based, Data Analytics platform for data integration, enterprise data warehousing(Native to MS, To create pipelines)
8. Azure ML: To dev & deploy ML models.
9. Cognitive Services: to enable apps to see, hear, speak, understand & interpret a user needs.
10. Azure Bot Services: To dev intelligent, enterprise level bots.

11. Serverless Computing:
- Azure Function: Event based code running for the services in Azure.(Eg. HTTP, Timer, Storage, Queue msg, email Triggers )
- Azure Logic Apps: Automate & orchestrate tasks, biz processes & workflow to integrate apps.

12. DevOps & Git hub:
1. Azure DevOps: Collaboration b/w Dev & Ops to automate deployment of apps
2. Git hub: version control system for codes.
3. Git Hub Action: Automate workflow to build, test, deploy from GitHub.
4. DevTest Labs: quickly created Env to deploy the code to minimize waste n cost.

13. Azure Monitor: To improve Availability & performance to collect, analyze, act from on prem/cloud env.
14. App Insights, Log analytics, Smart Alerts, Automation Actions, Customized Dashboard. 
15. Azure Health Services: All running service health check, to debug issue.
16. ARM template: JSON based files to create, deploy the Azure infra without write code.

17. Azure Security Center: 
- Monitoring service for threat protection for on-prem, Azure.
- Sec recommendations, detect & block malware, analyze & identify attacks, Just-in-time access (on demand the port open for RDP)
	
18. Azure Key vault: App uses below services in background for authentication of users.
- Secret(password etc )
- Key(Public/private encry. key)
- Certificate(SSL certs etc)
	
19. Azure Dedicated Host: Use for isolation, pyhsical servers to host azure VMs.

20. Secure N/W connectivity: Achieve by below points.
- Defence in depth: Security at each layer of arch. 
- (Physical Security > Identity & Access > Perimeter(DDoS protection) > Network(NSG) > Compute > Application > Data)

21. NSG (network sec groups): use to filtering Inbound & Outbound traffic (IP, Port of dest, IP , Port of source, Protocol)
- Az firewall: FaaS, same as NSG but compute az network a traffic filtered, scalable, Log the activity. 
- Az App Gateway (for Application: WAF)
- Az Ddos protection: protect from false request.
